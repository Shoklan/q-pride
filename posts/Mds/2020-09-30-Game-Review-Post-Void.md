About a month ago I Steam was kind enough to recommend a rough looking LSD-inspired shooter. And, this little gem is called Post Void created by a little Developer group called YCJY Games. Looking at the videos, screenshots and description I was immediately sold:

“*Post Void is a hypnotic scramble of early first-person shooter design that values speed above all else. Keep your head full and reach the end; Kill what you can to see it mend; Get the high score or try again.*”


The game delivers on all of that with the classic Arcade Shooter style that I miss everytime I spin up any modern First Person Shooter and with a price tag of $2.99, there wasn’t any risk.

There is a tutorial level to get you acquainted with the basic ideas of the game - which is really just:
You have a slide like many modern shooters.
Your health is that glass tiki skull which drains away.
Then you’re dropped right in and good luck.

The management of your health which forces you to press on creates a fun stresser which is simple but not overwhelming to manage: kill to fill. The enemy varieties are also limited for the 11 stages you race through - which isn’t all that many. It’s not a long game and wouldn’t actually mind seeing a Post Void 2 which pulls some elements from Rouge-likes and maybe a bit of coop shuffle. Also, the aim is a bit forgiving and there were moments where I was sure I would miss but still killed an enemy.

The art style is a bit rough on the eyes at first but actually is the right choice to make registering enemies and threats blend into the background just enough that you can miss or run right into them if you’re not careful. I’m also partial to colorful games so I admit this visually is my kind of game.


All in all, I’d recommend stuffing this game into downtime between lobbies and breaks between studying to stay alert.

Also, the Shotgun is best.
Who knows why anyone wants to use the knife: weirdos.
