The Voices of the Void by David Stewart is a pleasant short story that mixes a Science Fiction backdrop with some supernatural horror. We join the introduced protagonist - Andrew Dalatent  - entering a mining colony called New Gibralter where he appears tasked with figuring out what happened to the people there. And, I say it appears because as he starts his descent you find out he’s more aware of the whys and whats of the situation than is initially let on.

Coupled with his own supernatural ability to observe future and past versions of events around him, we get to join him as he tries to survive against humanity removed of its own free will. These sections that Stewart uses were my own personal favorite because they’re surprisingly easy to follow but also because they grow slowly out of being just a novel tactic Andrew uses to protect himself into an important aspect of the later story.

Short read but enjoyable.
