## Inspiration
While working on a script that I'm writing for work, I was having trouble really tracking down where my logic was failing. After looking over the code, everything looked correct but the results were showing me otherwise. So, I opened up python's debugging system and started to dig in.

## What is Debugging?
> In computer programming and software development, debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems.

There are plenty of tools to do stuff like this but Python comes with its own: pdb â€” [The Python Debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html).
To activate it, you'd simply go into your terminal and type:
```
user@station# python3 -m pdb <script-name>
```
This with start the script from the top and immediately stop before running anything:
```
user@station:/scripts# python3 -m pdb keyIntegrityCheck.py
> /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py(5)<module>()
-> from pathlib import Path
(Pdb)
```
While this is useful, we need to be able to explore the file. You could keep an editor open on a different monitor and move around but sometimes that's not going to be an option. To print all the lines in the file  you'd use:
```
(Pdb) ll                                                                                    
1     #!/usr/bin/env python3                                        
2     ## Author: Collin Mitchell                                 
3     ## Purpose: To check the integrity of keys without user input.  
4                                                                               
5  -> from pathlib import Path                                                   
6     from itertools import filterfalse                                            
7     import subprocess as sp                                                          
8     import json                                                                     
9     import sys    
# ...
370                 integrityFunc = dd.get(str(filename).split('.')[-1])
371                 if integrityFunc:
372                     consistent = integrityFunc( filename )
373                     if not consistent: print("{} is not consistent.".format(filename))
374                 else:
375                     print("{} is missing a checker; please report {} so it can be added.".format(filename,filename))
(Pdb)
```
You can see the pointer on line five telling us where the current execution point is. We can move the pointer a single line using `n`:
```
(Pdb) n                                                                                                                                                                   [336/1995]
> /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py(6)<module>()
-> from itertools import filterfalse                   
(Pdb) ll                                                                                    
  1     #!/usr/bin/env python3                                        
  2     ## Author: Collin Mitchell                                 
  3     ## Purpose: To check the integrity of keys without user input.  
  4                                                                               
  5     from pathlib import Path                                                   
  6  -> from itertools import filterfalse                                            
  7     import subprocess as sp                                                          
  8     import json                                                                     
  9     import sys     
```
You can see the next 11 lines in the console buffer using `l`:
```
(Pdb) l
  1     #!/usr/bin/env python3
  2     ## Author: Collin Mitchell
  3     ## Purpose: To check the integrity of keys without user input.
  4  
  5     from pathlib import Path
  6  -> from itertools import filterfalse
  7     import subprocess as sp
  8     import json
  9     import sys
 10  
 11     # stuff to do with phpserialize:
(Pdb)
```
Not that if you do this and run it again that you wont get the same result:
```
(Pdb) l
 12     import codecs
 13     try:
 14         codecs.lookup_error('surrogateescape')
 15         default_errors = 'surrogateescape'
 16     except LookupError:
 17         default_errors = 'strict'
 18     try:
 19         xrange
 20     except NameError:
 21         xrange = range
 22     try:
(Pdb)
```
... but you will get the **next** 11 lines instead. You can tell it which lines to list centered on a line number using `l 10`:
```
(Pdb) l 10
  5     from pathlib import Path
  6  -> from itertools import filterfalse
  7     import subprocess as sp
  8     import json
  9     import sys
 10  
 11     # stuff to do with phpserialize:
 12     import codecs
 13     try:
 14         codecs.lookup_error('surrogateescape')
 15         default_errors = 'surrogateescape'
(Pdb)
```
Now that we can move around, let's discuss how to actually stop code execution using **breakpoints**. These are locations you set - sometimes with conditions - to stop the code execution and explore the current state. You can set these using 'b':
```
(Pdb) b
(Pdb)
```
Since we don't have any breakpoints set, then it makes sense we don't see any listed. So, now lets set one:
```
(Pdb) b 9
Breakpoint 1 at /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py:9
(Pdb)
```
... and continue execution until the breakpoint using `c`:
```
(Pdb) c
> /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py(9)<module>()
-> import sys
(Pdb)
```
... and list the active breakpoints again:
```
(Pdb) b
Num Type         Disp Enb   Where
1   breakpoint   keep yes   at /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py:9
        breakpoint already hit 1 time
(Pdb)
```
You can clear that breakpoint using the number of the breakpoint as well:
```
(Pdb) b
Num Type         Disp Enb   Where
1   breakpoint   keep yes   at /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py:9
        breakpoint already hit 1 time
(Pdb) cl 1
Deleted breakpoint 1 at /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py:9
(Pdb) b
(Pdb)
```
Conditional breakpoints I found a bit tricky to get to work correctly because you need to place a comma after the statement:
```
(Pdb) b 371, integrityFunc.__name__ == 'integrityPhp'
Breakpoint 3 at /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py:371
(Pdb)
```
... and then you `c` until it triggers:
```
> /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py(371)<module>()
-> if integrityFunc:
(Pdb) integrityFunc
<function integrityPhp at 0x7f99291477b8>
(Pdb)
```

## Conclusion
I couldn't find much outside of the official documentation when I needed it so hopefully you find the highlights useful.
There are also tools for whichever IDE you're using so look out for those as well.
