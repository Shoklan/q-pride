### Read 100 Books.
This is a challenge because I haven't done it yet and fitting that many books into my life forces me to think about my spent time.
With 52 weeks in the year, this means I will need to read 1.92 books per week. If I'm going to have a break day from everything - on Sundays - then that usually means reading about 100-134 pages of the current novel per day.
Doing this along with being productive and pursuing larger goals gets it onto my list.


### Create Three Potential Streams of Income.
I wont be discussing what those are but if modern society and the current state of affairs has taught me anything it's to be proactive. You don't want to be responding to a loss after it's happened; you want to have responded before it has happened. Always have a plan B - and maybe a C. If you need your computer to work, then you'll want a fallback that can throw in as a substitute. With working from home, the first thing I did was check to see if I can use my phone as a substitute for if my ISP decides to do "maintenance." It works by the way.
I wont hold myself to actually generating an income yet but that's a stretch goal for the year.


### New Job Title
I'm bored of being a Senior at this point and either need some larger technical challenges or just a swap in the set of responsibilities I deal with on a daily basis. There are some possibilities which I will try either to create or follow up on but I'm not staying where I am.


### A Blog Post a Month.
I have this place where I can drop interesting project ideas or discuss problems that I've solved for myself to share with others. Since I don't have a lack of problems to solve, then I should be writing about them for others to read and refer back to. Solving a problem a month is not the challenge but remembering to write about it is.


### Draw An Original Comic.
If you're following me on any social media then you've probably seen some crude drawings. While I admit I'm doing them for my own enjoyment - and challenge - I should push towards something tangible.
