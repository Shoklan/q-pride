    "This post series was inspired by the *Korolev* Job **And Two Smoking Barrels** where upon accepting the quest I realized how terrible the rewards were in comparison. For those that don't play the game a little background will be necessary. **The Cycle: Frontier** is an *Evacuation Shooter* game and there are three main Corporations - or Organizations, if you prefer - who act as quest and reward givers in the game. There are two kinds of these: **Campaign** and **Jobs**. Whereas the *campaign quests* will push you along to different areas of the world, instead the *Jobs* function as a way to collect scrips and excuse to send players to the planet."

    "For *Deposit Jobs*, you carry the requested items to a **Dead Drop** and then deposit the items in question. For this one, it requires you deposit a gun you purchase from the shop. Now, you could *find* this weapon or loot it from other people but those are not garunteed at all. The Kmark - which is cash, basically - reward is $19,000 and the gun it wants you to deposit is $22,000 so there is no reason to take this job unless you already have this gun. Anyways, lets get to the fun part."
