    "While preparing for some upcoming blog posts taking material from **Design and Analysis of Experiments With R** by *John Lawson*, I wanted to convert the problems and solutions from `R` code to `Python` code. Diong this will require using the real data and - luckily - the data from the book is online on [Github](https://github.com/cran/daewr). Due to how these packages are, the [data](https://github.com/cran/daewr/tree/master/data) is uploaded and kept as binary data which we can use. Unfortunately, the data is in the `.rda` format which doesn't convert easily into python."
