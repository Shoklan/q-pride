While the example in the class picked - as far as I can tell - random numbers to fill them in, I would hope that the numbers provided here would be based on research of other similar projects. At least, I would hope in the real world this is was happens."

If given the choice between `$100` now and `$100` in a year then you'd obviously take the `$100` now. This also applies to money we earn in the future: `$60` now is better than the `$60` we'd earn in the future. So, example time."

We're going to do something a bit more modern and say we're investing in a growing Online Streamer with the expectation that we'll get some of the money in turn. A deal is worked out and you'll be getting some kind of slice of the money they make in exchange. They're going to ask for `$500` in investment. For the interest rate, we'll use the **Inflation Rate** since this is not a loan. Right now, it's `8.2%` so we'll use that as our Interest Rate; Sometimes this also called the **Discount Rate** and *Inflation* certainly applies.\n",
