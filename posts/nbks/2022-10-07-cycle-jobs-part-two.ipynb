    "As I discussed in the previous post, there are three kinds of jobs: *Collect*, *Deposit* and *Kill*. The *Collect* and *Deposit* jobs are fine since they involved something easily quantifiable: **loot**. However, the *Kill* quests present a very real problem since there is no simple way to address quanitfying them. For killing creatures, maybe we could take the sum of their expected drops and their rate of drop and include that as part of the rewards? Of course, the player may simply choose not to pick any of that up.\n",
